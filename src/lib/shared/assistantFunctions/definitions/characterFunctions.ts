		description: `Create or update a character draft based on user requirements. The draft is saved to the chat and shown to the user for review before being saved to the database. 

**When to use**: 
- User asks to create/draft a character
- User asks to modify an existing draft (e.g., "reroll personality", "change the description", "add more details")

**How to call**:
{reasoning: "User wants to create/modify [type of character]", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"[exact user request here]", additionalFields:["personality","scenario"])]}

**Examples - Creating new drafts**:
- User: "Create a cowboy character" → {reasoning: "Creating cowboy character", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"Create a cowboy character", additionalFields:["personality","scenario"])]}
- User: "Make a detective named Sarah who is cynical" → {reasoning: "Creating detective character", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"Make a detective named Sarah who is cynical", additionalFields:["personality","scenario"])]}

**Examples - Modifying existing drafts**:
- User: "Reroll his personality" → {reasoning: "User wants to regenerate personality field", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"Reroll his personality", additionalFields:["personality"])]}
- User: "Change the description" → {reasoning: "User wants to regenerate description", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"Change the description", additionalFields:[])]}
- User: "Make him more cynical" → {reasoning: "User wants to modify personality", functions: [draftCharacter(userRequest:"Make him more cynical", additionalFields:["personality"])]}

**CRITICAL**: 
- ALWAYS use the CURRENT user message as userRequest, not previous messages
- NEVER create character details yourself
- NEVER output JSON schemas or API endpoints
- Only call this function with the exact format shown above`,
